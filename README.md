# MIT-OCW-Intro-to-comp-sci-prog


The scripts are my solutions to the problem sets of the Introduction to computer science and programming course on MIT OCW.
Each folder contains the problem set and my solution.
The programs are my attempt to build my skills in programming and computer science fundamentals.
