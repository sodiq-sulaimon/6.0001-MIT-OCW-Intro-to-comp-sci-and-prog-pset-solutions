# MIT-OCW-6.0001: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming


The scripts are my solutions to the problem sets of the Introduction to computer science and programming course on MIT OCW.

Each folder contains the problem set and my solution. The folders will be updated as I progress in the course and complete the assignments.

The programs are my attempt to build my skills in programming and computer science fundamentals. 

P.S: If anyone is also taking the course and finds my solution useful, feel free to copy the codes to gain clarity on how to solve the problems. 
Also, if you need me to explain any part of the solution to you, you can shoot me a message.
