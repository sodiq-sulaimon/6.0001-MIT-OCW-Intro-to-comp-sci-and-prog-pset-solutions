# MIT-OCW-6.0001: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming

The scripts are my solutions to the problem sets of the Introduction to computer science and programming course on MIT OCW. Each folder contains the problem set and my solution. The folders will be updated as I progress in the course and complete the assignments.

The programs are part of my efforts to build my skills in programming and computer science fundamentals. 

A bit about the problem sets:

Problem set 0 : This problem introduced me to the programming environment selected for the course, to programming in Python, as well as to the general problem set structure. In this problem set, I wrote a simple Python program that computes square and log base 2 of a number

Problem set 1: In this problem set I learnt how to use control flow in Python and how to formulate a computational solution to a problem.  I also explored bisection search to write a program that calculates how long it would take to save up downpayment for a house.   

Problem set 2: In this problem set, I learnt about creating functions in Python, as well as looping mechanisms for repeating a computational process until a condition is reached.   I used the knowledge to implement hangman game.

Problem set 3: In this problem set, I implemented a version of the 6.0001 word game! This game is a lot like Scrabble or Words With Friends. Letters are dealt to players, who then construct one or more words using their letters. Each valid word earns the user points, based on the length of the word and the letters in that word.

Problem set 4: This problem set has two parts. The first part allows me to practice thinking about problems in a recursive fashion, taking advantage of the idea that one can reduce the problem to a simpler version of the same problem. In ps4a.py, I wrote a recursive function that takes as input a string and figures out all the possible reorderings of the characters in the string. 

The second part gave me experience in thinking about problems in terms of classes, each instance of which contains specific attributes as well as methods for manipulating them. In ps4b.py, I used object-oriented programming to write a Caesar/shift cipher. In ps4c.py , I used object-oriented programming to write a simple substitution cipher.


P.S: If anyone is also taking the course and finds my solution useful, feel free to copy the codes to gain clarity on how to solve the problems. 
Also, if you need me to explain any part of the solution to you, you can shoot me a message.
